                <h2>Qualifications and Licenses</h2>
                <p>Regarding electrical work, one of the most important factors to consider is the qualifications and licenses of the Contractor you're hiring. Electrical work can be dangerous, and only licensed and qualified professionals should be trusted to perform it.</p>

                <h2>Importance of Ensuring that the Electrical Contractor is Licensed</h2>
                <p>
                    Ensuring that an electrical contractor is licensed in Melbourne is extremely important for several reasons:
                    Safety: Electrical work can be dangerous, and it's essential to ensure that the Contractor has the necessary training and qualifications to perform the job safely.
